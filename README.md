This block sorts the elements of the input vector using the quicksort algorithm as described in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort

Quicksort is the world's most widely used sorting algorithm, and perhaps even the world's most widely used algorithm of any kind.
More info on the mathematical behavior of the algorithm can be found in http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Quicksort.html
